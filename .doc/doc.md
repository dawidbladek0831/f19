# Text-to-Speech System Architecture
_This document outlines the architectural blueprint for the Text-to-Speech (TTS) system, providing a structured and comprehensive overview of its design, components, and operational considerations. The report leverages the arc42 template for its standardized, pragmatic structure and integrates the C4 model for clear, hierarchical visual representations of the architecture._

The TTS system is designed to process text files (TXT, PDF), convert them into audio using Text-to-Speech models, and enable audio playback. Its core components include an Angular-based Frontend application, a Synthesizer application responsible for text-to-audio conversion, a File Storage application for managing files, and Keycloak as an identity provider.

# 1. Introduction and Goals
_This section establishes the foundational context for the TTS system, defining its purpose, identifying stakeholders, and outlining the quality attributes that guide its design._

## 1.1. Requirements Overview
The primary functional requirement of the TTS system involves:
- capability to upload various text file formats, specifically TXT and PDF;
- subsequently convert files content into audio;
- ability to play the generated audio; and
- manage user accounts. 

Beyond core functionality, the system is designed to meet several high-level non-functional requirements. These include:
- ensuring efficient audio generation performance;
- maintaining high system availability; and 
- ensuring the overall maintainability of the codebase.

## 1.2. Quality Goals
The top quality attributes for the TTS system are critical drivers for its architectural design. These include:
- achieving high performance in audio generation;
- ensuring scalability to support a growing number of concurrent users;
- implementing strong security for user data and access control; and
- designing for maintainability to facilitate future enhancements.

## 6.1. User Authentication
1. The User accesses the Frontend page and start login process.
2. The Frontend redirects the User's browser to the Keycloak login page.
3. The User enters credentials on the Keycloak page.
4. Keycloak authenticates the User.
5. Upon successful authentication, Keycloak issues an access token and an ID token to the Frontend (via browser redirect/callback).
6. The Frontend stores the tokens securely and uses token to authorize subsequent requests to the Synthesizer Service and File Storage Service.

## 6.3. File to Audio
1. The User open a text file (TXT or PDF) through the Frontend.
2. The Front convert file content to text.
2. The Frontend sends a synthesis request, to the Synthesizer Service via a REST API call.
3. The Synthesizer Service receives the request and generate audio file.
4. The Angular Frontend retrieves the audio file and plays it for the User.

# 7. Deployment View

# 8. Crosscutting Concepts
_This section describes overarching principles, patterns, or solution ideas that are relevant across multiple parts of the TTS system. These concepts ensure consistency and conceptual integrity throughout the architecture._

## 8.1 Authentication and Authorization
The system integrates Keycloak as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution, eliminating the need to develop custom authentication and authorization mechanisms. This choice reduces development effort, enhances security, and ensures compliance with modern authentication standards like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

# 9. Architecture Decisions
_Architectural decisions are made with specific trade-offs and constraints in mind._
## 9.1. Architecture Decision Record Template

    Data: 2025-6-15
    
    Status: Accepted
    
    Context: We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

    Decision: template from article:
    https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

    Consequences: From now we will use Nygard's template, link above.


## 9.2. Decision: Using Keycloak for Identity Management

    Date: 2023-12-01

    Status: Accepted

    Context: The system requires robust user authentication and authorization, support for standard protocols (OAuth2, OpenID Connect), and centralized user management capabilities.

    Decision: Integrate Keycloak as the primary identity provider for user authentication and authorization.

    Consequences:

        Easier: Leverages a mature, open-source solution for secure authentication, supports industry-standard protocols, provides a comprehensive administration console for user management, and enables future SSO capabilities.

        Harder: Requires Keycloak setup, configuration, and ongoing maintenance, introduces a learning curve for developers to integrate with OAuth2/OpenID Connect flows, and adds another component to the system's operational footprint.

# 10. Quality Requirements
_This section expands upon the high-level quality goals introduced in Section 1, detailing them as measurable quality scenarios. This approach transforms abstract desires into verifiable architectural outcomes, providing clear targets for design, implementation, and testing._

## 10.1. Performance
Synthesizer Service shall generate and make the audio file within 5 seconds. After that, service should be able to genereate next audio before first ends.

# 11. Risks and Technical Debt
_This section identifies known problems, potential risks, and accumulated technical debt within the TTS system, along with proposed mitigation strategies._

## 11.1. Risks

### 11.1.1 Free TTS models

    ID: R01

    Describtion: Not all TTS models are free to use

    Status: Open

    Impact: the need to be limited only to free models

    Mitigation Strategy: learn own models

## 11.2. Technical Debts
### 11.2.1. E2E testing

    ID: TD01

    Describtion: Lack of Automated End-to-End Testing

    Status: Open

    Impact: Increased risk of regressions; manual testing is time-consuming and error-prone; slower release cycles.

    Proposed Solution: Develop comprehensive end-to-end test suites covering critical user flows
