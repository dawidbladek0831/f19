## 6.1. User Authentication
1. The User accesses the Frontend page and start login process.
2. The Frontend redirects the User's browser to the Keycloak login page.
3. The User enters credentials on the Keycloak page.
4. Keycloak authenticates the User.
5. Upon successful authentication, Keycloak issues an access token and an ID token to the Frontend (via browser redirect/callback).
6. The Frontend stores the tokens securely and uses token to authorize subsequent requests to the Synthesizer Service and File Storage Service.

## 6.3. File to Audio
1. The User open a text file (TXT or PDF) through the Frontend.
2. The Front convert file content to text.
2. The Frontend sends a synthesis request, to the Synthesizer Service via a REST API call.
3. The Synthesizer Service receives the request and generate audio file.
4. The Angular Frontend retrieves the audio file and plays it for the User.

# 7. Deployment View
_Software needs hardware to execute on, thatâ€™s where the deployment view comes into play: It shows the technical infrastructure with environments, computers, processors, networks and network-topologies._

3 deployment environments

# 7.1. Development environment
![Alt text](./export/diagram-deployment_development_textToSpeechSystem.drawio.png)

## 7.1.1. Setup infrastructure 
### Kafka

    $ docker-compose -p f19 -f .\.docker\docker-compose-kafka.yaml up -d

### Mongo

    $ docker-compose -p f19 -f .\.docker\docker-compose-mongo.yaml up -d

## 7.1.2. Setup external systems

- Create user

### File Storage

    $ docker-compose -p f19 -f .\.docker\docker-compose-file_storage.yaml up -d

## 7.1.3. Synthesizer
Setting up the Synthesizer Service for local development involves several steps to ensure all dependencies are met and the application can run correctly. 
### 7.1.3.1. Setup
#### Virtual Environment
It is a recommended practice to isolate project-specific Python dependencies using a virtual environment. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects or system-wide packages.

Create the virtual environment within the project's root directory

    $ python3 -m venv.venv

Next, activate the newly created virtual environment

    $ source.venv/bin/activate

#### Installing Python Dependencies
Install the core Python packages specified in the requirements.txt file:

    (.venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Install FastAPI along with a set of recommended optional dependenciesâ€”such as uvicorn, httpx, and othersâ€”primarily for running and testing FastAPI applications.

    (.venv)$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

#### Installing _espeak_
As previously noted, espeak is a critical system-level dependency for the phonemizer library, which the Synthesizer Service relies on for its text processing capabilities. 

Update your system's package lists and install espeak

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install espeak -y

#### Downloading Text-to-Speech Models
The Synthesizer Service operates using text-to-speech models that are stored locally within the ./models directory. These models are not included in the Git repository and must be downloaded manually as a distinct setup step. The project provides specific Jupyter notebooks located in the ./notebooks directory to facilitate this download process.

Install ipykernel. This registers your virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel, allowing notebooks to correctly utilize the Python packages installed within your project's isolated environment.

    (.venv)$ python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"

Start Jupyter Notebook

    (.venv)$ jupyter notebook

It is crucial to change the **kernel** for the notebook to "Python (myenv)" (or the display name assigned to your virtual environment). This ensures the notebook's code executes within your project's isolated environment, accessing the correct dependencies.

In the Jupyter web interface that opens in your browser, navigate to the ./notebooks directory and open the model download notebook.

Execute cells within the notebook to initiate the model download process. The models will be saved to the ./models directory.

After the notebooks complete execution, verify that the necessary model files are present in the ./models directory within your project's root.

### 7.1.3.2. Running
#### Development
Ensure your Python virtual environment is active

    $ source .venv/bin/activate

Start the FastAPI development server

    (.venv)$ fastapi dev app/main.py

The service will typically become accessible via your web browser or API client at http://localhost:8080. Interactive API documentation, including Swagger UI and ReDoc, can then be accessed at http://localhost:8080/docs and http://localhost:8080/redoc respectively.

#### Docker
In some development workflows, it might be preferable to run just image. In that case you no need to complete setup's steps.

    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/dawidbladek0831/synthesizer:latest

### 7.1.3.3. Dockerization 
The Synthesizer Service can be containerized by building a Docker image. The project's Dockerfile is located in the .docker/Dockerfile path.

To build the Docker image, the docker buildx build command is utilized.

    $ sudo docker buildx build . -f .docker/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/dawidbladek0831/synthesizer:latest

To change image's tag to corresponding version

    $ docker tag ghcr.io/dawidbladek0831/synthesizer:latest ghcr.io/dawidbladek0831/synthesizer:1.0.0

## 8.1 Authentication and Authorization
The system integrates Keycloak as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution, eliminating the need to develop custom authentication and authorization mechanisms. This choice reduces development effort, enhances security, and ensures compliance with modern authentication standards like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

# 9. Architecture Decisions
_Architectural decisions are made with specific trade-offs and constraints in mind._
## 9.1. Architecture Decision Record Template

    Data: 2025-6-15
    
    Status: Accepted
    
    Context: We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

    Decision: template from article:
    https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

    Consequences: From now we will use Nygard's template, link above.


## 9.2. Decision: Using Keycloak for Identity Management

    Date: 2023-12-01

    Status: Accepted

    Context: The system requires robust user authentication and authorization, support for standard protocols (OAuth2, OpenID Connect), and centralized user management capabilities.

    Decision: Integrate Keycloak as the primary identity provider for user authentication and authorization.

    Consequences:

        Easier: Leverages a mature, open-source solution for secure authentication, supports industry-standard protocols, provides a comprehensive administration console for user management, and enables future SSO capabilities.

        Harder: Requires Keycloak setup, configuration, and ongoing maintenance, introduces a learning curve for developers to integrate with OAuth2/OpenID Connect flows, and adds another component to the system's operational footprint.
